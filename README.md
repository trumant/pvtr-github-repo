# Privateer Plugin for GitHub Repositories

This application performs automated assessments against GitHub repositories using controls defined in the [Open Source Project Security Baseline v2025.02.25](https://baseline.openssf.org). The application consumes the OSPS Baseline controls using [Gemara](https://github.com/ossf/gemara) layer 2 and produces results of the automated assessments using layer 4.

Many of the assessments depend upon the presence of a [Security Insights](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights) file at the root of the repository, or `./github/security-insights.yml`.

## Work in Progress

Currently 39 control requirements across OSPS Baselines levels 1-3 are covered, with 13 not yet implemented. [Maturity Level 1](https://baseline.openssf.org/versions/2025-02-25.html#level-1) requirements are the most rigorously tested and are recommended for use. The results of these layer 1 assessments are integrated into [LFX Insights](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/k8s/repository/kubernetes-kubernetes/security), powering the [Security & Best Practices results](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/docs/metrics/security/).

Level 2 and Level 3 requirements are undergoing current development and may be less rigorously tested.

## Docker Usage

```sh
# build the image
docker build . -t local
docker run \
  --mount type=bind,source=./config.yml,destination=/.privateer/config.yml \
  --mount type=bind,source=./evaluation_results,destination=/.privateer/bin/evaluation_results \
  local
```

## GitHub Actions Usage

We've pushed an image to docker hub for use in GitHub Actions.

You will also need to set up a GitHub personal access token with the repository read permissions. This token should be added to your config file, or — if using the example pipeline below — as a secret in your repository.
